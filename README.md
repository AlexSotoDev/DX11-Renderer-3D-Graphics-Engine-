# DX11-Renderer-3D-Graphics-Engine
A 3D renderer written in C++/HLSL using DirectX11 that I developed for a 3D graphics programming course at DePaul University from January 2017 - March 2017

Open FinalProject.svn and run the application to get a demo scene demonstrating the DX11 Application I wrote to demo the graphics pipeline, handling models, textures, different shaders/PBR lighting, skyboxes, terrain and fog!
